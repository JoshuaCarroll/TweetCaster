TweetCaster is a Windows desktop application written in C# that is made for use by anyone producing a video broadcast, podcast or live stream, which allows one to easily incorporate feedback from viewers through social media.

## Initial installation (quick & dirty documented)

The only system prerequisite is .NET Framework v4.5.  Upon initial installation the program will create a new local database in the user's roaming app data folder for the data queue and user settings.

## Developing

I initially wrote this for my own use in producing the live broadcast of our high school's football games.  I later decided to share it with others.  Any C# developer is welcome to assist on this project.  Just make sure to submit your well documented pull request to the development branch.

## Other ways to contribute

If you can't help with the programming, feel free to contribute by using the application and opening Issues on GitHub when you find a bug or have a suggestion.  Alternatively, you could just help pay the bills by leaving some gratuity at https://gratipay.com/joshua_carroll/.
